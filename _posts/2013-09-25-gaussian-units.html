I have been hesitant to use Born and Wolf because they use Gaussian Units.  The reputation of the book was strong enough for me to overcome my concern, and it turns out Gaussian Units are not so bad.  It was a revelation to me that you could have a unit system without a unit for charge.  But what does charge mean aside from its abilities to create forces?

Geometric optics is simple, intuitive, and easy to simulate.  The fundamental theories are not quite as simple.

You can derive the Eikonal equation from Maxwell's equations.

Assume a time-harmonic field:

\begin{align*}
\mathbf{E}(\mathbf{r}, t) &= \mathbf{E}_0(\mathbf{r})\exp^{-i\omega t} \\
\mathbf{B}(\mathbf{r}, t) &= \mathbf{B}_0(\mathbf{r})\exp^{-i\omega t}
\end{align*}
